# 🧠 PL/SQL – Cursors & Exception Handling

This repository contains my **PL/SQL Lab 3 & Lab 4** assignments focused on two important concepts in Oracle PL/SQL — **Cursors** and **Exception Handling**.

---

## 📘 Overview

The lab demonstrates how to manage data retrieval and error handling effectively within database programs using PL/SQL.  
It includes examples of both **student** and **employee** database operations.

### 🔹 Lab 3: Cursors in PL/SQL
Topics covered:
- Creating and using **explicit** and **parameterized cursors**
- Working with `%TYPE` and `%ROWTYPE`
- Stored **procedures** and **functions** using cursors
- Calculating totals, averages, and filtering records dynamically

### 🔹 Lab 4: Exception Handling in PL/SQL
Topics covered:
- Handling **predefined exceptions** (`NO_DATA_FOUND`, `TOO_MANY_ROWS`, `OTHERS`)
- Implementing **user-defined exceptions** for custom validation
- Writing clean and reliable PL/SQL blocks with proper exception handling

---

## 🧱 Tables Used
- **STUDENT** – Contains student information (marks, total, age)
- **EMP** – Contains employee data (job, department, salary)

---

## ⚙️ Requirements
- Oracle Database (11g or above)
- SQL*Plus or Oracle SQL Developer
- `SET SERVEROUTPUT ON` enabled to view results

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open Oracle SQL Developer or SQL*Plus.  
2. Copy the SQL code.
3. Execute the script to create tables, procedures, functions, and test blocks.  
4. View the output in the SQL console.

---

## 🧩 Learning Outcomes
- Understand **cursor processing** for multi-record handling.  
- Learn to manage **runtime errors** gracefully.  
- Build structured and reusable PL/SQL code using **procedures & functions**.
